# Introduction

Kuzzle can be customized and extended using plugins.

This page explains how to install and configure a plugin. The other pages cover the four plugin interfaces exposed by Kuzzle:

- [Hooks](/plugins/1/hooks/)
- [Pipes](/plugins/1/pipes/)
- [Controllers](/plugins/1/controllers/)
- [Authentication Strategies](/plugins/1/strategies/overview/)

A single plugin can implement as many of those interfaces as necessary.

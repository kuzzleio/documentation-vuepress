# Getting Started

Kuzzle emits numerous events, especially for API requests.

Plugins can [listen](/plugins/1/essentials/) to events.

And if a plugin adds new API [controllers](/plugins/1/essentials/controllers), then Kuzzle automatically triggers [dedicated events](/plugins/1/events/plugin-events).
